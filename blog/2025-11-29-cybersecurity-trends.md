Artificial Intelligence is a double-edged sword. While attackers are using AI to create more sophisticated phishing campaigns and malware, defenders are leveraging AI to detect anomalies and respond to threats in real-time.

## 2. Zero Trust Architecture

The "never trust, always verify" approach is becoming the standard. Zero Trust ensures that strict identity verification is required for every person and device trying to access resources on a private network.

## 3. Supply Chain Security

Recent high-profile attacks have highlighted the vulnerabilities in software supply chains. Organizations are now focusing more on securing their development pipelines and third-party dependencies.
